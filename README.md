# Basic_C-Sharp_Projects
 
These are some of the small projects and assignments that I made during the my C# and .NET Framework Course


One of the bigger projects [CarInsurance](https://github.com/kurtshall/Basic_C-Sharp_Projects/tree/main/CarInsurance) will mimic a car insurance website using a MVC web application. It takes user inputs and outputs a quote based on the information given. There is also a admin page that will display all the users inputted into the database.
